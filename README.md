# Yet Another Campfire Saving

[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly) has a campfire saving mode for players seeking an extra challenge, but the vanilla implementation has some annoying shortcomings.

There are a number of custom addons trying to address the issues with campfire saving, but they all leave something to be desired.

This is where **YACSâ„¢** steps in!

## Features

* High compatibility. Plays nicely with vanilla campfire mode _and_ without it.
* New game is not needed. You can activate campfire saving on an existing "standard" game.
* You can safely deactivate campfire saving by removing the addon from a standard game. Ya noob.
* Campfires need to be lit before you can save. Carry matchboxes.
* Nearby campfire radius is extended, so you can save without burning your feet.
* **You can also save within friendly bases**, as long as you are protected from emissions.
